This is hate propaganda, point blank. If it weren't for immigration most of us American Citizens would not be here.Our horrific actions against our Native bretheren is not forgotten by my account, or the enslavement of other non-native americans forced to work (Chinese, and African American people come to mind). This is not the vision our forefathers had. Who is in control of this twitter account? Hitler?
Oh that's right, our representatives that we voted for. Has anyone running that twitter account, picked up an elementary book on history? What honorable and trustworthy official would even post something un-checked, or un-challenged?

Immigration DOES NOT drive down our wages.
