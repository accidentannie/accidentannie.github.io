Just thought I'd share a few interesting facts I learned from Haven and AlcoholEdu. These mini-courses are a requirement before entering into Buffalo State College (as a freshman, or a transfer student like me!) They're informative and a bit surprising. Some of the statistics and general information has changed over the years (well since I've been in high school, 15 years ago!)

Take a look at some of the screen shots I've nabbed. I'll add more as I come across more and add them to this post.

That's it for now!
