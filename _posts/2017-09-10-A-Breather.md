## A Breather

Well we're in week 2.5 and I've had 1 homework assignment, and 2 pop quizzes (my online Theatre History class has regular homework. This I appreciate.) Shocking. I have so much time on my hands, that all I do is re-read material, and study. This isn't a bad thing. I've found some articles online that help you study, and retain information better. 

I've updated my banners for my social media accounts that allow banners. I've read a few books. I'm always with my kids, and I'm trying to fill in the extra time that I actually have! I think tomorrow in the morning I'll work on Theatre History some more. Current grade: 99%.

I feel accomplished.
