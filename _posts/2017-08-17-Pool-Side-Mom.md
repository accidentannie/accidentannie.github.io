Was outside for a good majority of the late morning through early afternoon. Wish I had the energy my son has! I need to put more gym hours in before college starts back up! Onto the latest adventure in websites! Going to get the mock up site finished by tonight. I shouldn't be having this much fun, but I am! Will also work on just transferring posts from old blog to here and pointing domain here too. Seems like the next logical step!
