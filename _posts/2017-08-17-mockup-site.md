So far I think I found the perfect CMS for our client. [Click here for the test site.](http://123.creating.win) It's not finished and I still have more to do. Told Mike I'd get this done last night, but OCD reared it's ugly head. I want this to be flawless! Cheers!

P.S. Honestly thinking at this point, I am moving my blog back over here. I love this much better!
