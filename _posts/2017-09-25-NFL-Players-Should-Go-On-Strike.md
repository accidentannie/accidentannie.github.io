My daughter and I listened to the radio every morning on the way to drop her off at school. She asked me why people were upset about NFL players not standing for the national anthem. I told her: it's our constitutional right as Americans to speak, not speak, stand, not stand, have opinions or not have opinions. I told her that personally, I believed there are other actions to get upset about. I told my daughter that I think people's feelings get misconstrued for fact or what "should be". Their heightened emotional state around the national anthem, (when people do not stand when it is being played), is based on personal experience and their feelings. What these football players did, was exercise their constitutional rights as Americans. Can you imagine if someone berated you for exercising your constitutional rights? 
  
**Fact: "...the First Amendment also protects citizens from being compelled to say or pay for certain speech. (West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, (1943))".** 
  
These players have a platform to express their dislike, no matter what that is. How they are treated WITHOUT THEIR UNIFORMS ON is something to wonder about. Take away all pretenses. Take away race, religion, sexuality, or even opinion. Read these two sentences:  
  
_"American citizens are being oppressed. American citizens' rights are being violated."_ 
  
How people are treated is based in reality and is not escapable nor should be acceptable. When you choose to ignore your fellow countrymen, it doesn't affect a few, it affects all of us as a nation. How we treat our citizens in our own country is parallel to how we operate as a country. Our dysfunctions as a country (no matter how important or unimportant), weakens our input as American on a global stage. Our permissiveness to the plight of our own people lowers our status to other nations, disrupts our economy, halts infrastructure changes, and causes educational setbacks for our children. 
  
In-fighting within our nation only proves how weak we are as a nation. We are not the most powerful country in the world if we tread on our most oppressed patriots.
